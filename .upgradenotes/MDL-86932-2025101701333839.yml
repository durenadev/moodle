        mod_choice_get_choice_results web service: new userresponse structure.
        The mod_choice_get_choice_results web service now includes a new
        userresponse field that returns the current user selections in a
        structured format with optionid and text properties. This enhancement
        provides better access to user choice data for API consumers.
